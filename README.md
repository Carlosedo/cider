This is my [cider](https://github.com/msanders/cider) config. It downloads and put in place every file and folder, so to format should be painless from now :)

Acknowledgements
================

Thanks to [gtramontina](https://github.com/gtramontina/dotfiles) I discovered
**cider**, and I caught some of their config files.

I steal some config files from [igalarza's dotfiles](https://github.com/igalarzab/dotfiles) too.
